# Envault CLI

[Envault](https://github.com/envault/envault) is a repository for your .env secrets. It lets you manage and sync your entire teamâ€™s local .env variables across all your projects, so youâ€™re all kept up to date with the latest changes. Simply install your Envault server and you're ready to sync. ðŸš€

The Envault CLI allows you to connect to your Envault server and sync its credentials to your local .env file.

## Usage

To use the Envault CLI, you must have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your computer.

On your Envault dashboard, you will find a setup command for each app, which you can run to establish a connection to your Envault server, and sync your local .env. This command only needs to be run the first time you connect your .env to Envault. An example setup command:

```
npx envault vault.envault.dev 84632 iCNaGGLou6v0mRas
```

After you've run your app setup command for the first time, you can sync your .env again easily:

```
npx envault
```
